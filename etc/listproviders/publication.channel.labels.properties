list.name=PUBLICATION.CHANNEL.LABELS
# This list provider allows you to configure names for publications shown in the event details in the admin ui. The
# names are configured with key value pairs with the form channelid=name.

# For example to set a custom label for engage instead of the default
# engage-player=This is a new title for an engage publication

# For OAIMPH publications where the repository you are publishing to is "default" you could set:
# oaipmh-default=EVENTS.EVENTS.DETAILS.GENERAL.OAIPMH

# For a publish-configure publication you need to use the channel id. For example if you had the workflow:
# <operation
#   id="publish-configure"
# ...
#   <configurations>
# ...
#     <configuration key="channel-id">api</configuration>
# ...
#   </configurations>
# </operation>
# Configuring the label would be:
api=EVENTS.EVENTS.DETAILS.GENERAL.EXTERNAL_API
oaipmh-default=Default OAI-PMH Repository
