Upgrading Opencast 2.3 To 3.0
=============================

This guide describes how to upgrade Opencast 2.3.x to 3.x. In case you need information about how to upgrade older
versions of Opencast, please refer to the [old release notes](https://docs.opencast.org).


How to Upgrade
--------------

1. Download Opencast 3.0
2. Stop your current Opencast instance
3. Back-up Opencast files and database (optional)
4. [Upgrade the database](#database-migration)
5. Update the third party tools
6. Replace Opencast 2.3 with 3.0
7. Recreate admin ui search index
8. Review the configuration changes and adjust your configuration accordingly


Database Migration
------------------

Opencast 3.0 includes the following database changes:

1. Support for OAI-PMH (MH-12013)
2. Fix for a mis-named role name for the External API (MH-12015)

It should be needless to say that this migration should not take a lot of time and should be safe. Nevertheless, as with
all database migrations, we recommend to make a database backup before attempting the upgrade.

You can find the database upgrade script at `â€¦/docs/upgrade/2.3_to_3.0/`.

Recreate Admin UI Search Index
------------------------------

MH-11861 needs the admin ui search index to be recreated. This can be achieved by calling POST /admin-ng/index/recreateIndex
using the REST-API Docs.
Note the rebuilding the search index may take hours depending on how much data needs to be reindexed.

Configuration Changes
---------------------

1. The parameter "karaf.shutdown.pid.file" is renamed to "karaf.pid.file" (MH-12188)
2. The optional organization property 'prop.adminui.user.listname' can be used to set the display format of users in
    the group editor (MH-12211)

Requirements Changes
--------------------

Note that Opencast 3.0 requires Java 1.8. In case you used Java 1.7 for Opencast 2.3, you will also need to update Java.
